                        Dassault Systemes' main product SOLIDWORKS is a 3D modeling program that is primarily marketed to college students and trained engineers. Younger generations are not exposed to this software until high school or later. In response to this need, Dassault created SOLIDWORKS Apps for Kids, an entirely new suite of products that aims to bring these design tools to a younger demographic.

                        My senior capstone project, which was sponsored by Dassault, was to build the newest addition to Apps for Kids: Spark It. The primary goal of this app is to teach kids electrical engineering concepts, like current and voltage. Due to NDA, I can't share full screenshots of Spark It, but I can explain the design process that I used to create the user interface.

                        Before our team built anything for the app, our team wanted to conduct user interviews to understand how kids think about circuits. As engineering students who have taken electrical engineering classes, we did not want to make assumptions about what kids did or did not already know. I looked into existing products in the market to see how other companies have been able to teach circuits to kids. Snap Circuits, Circuit Maze, and littleBits are examples of games where kids can build circuits from scratch, similar to the vision for Spark It. I wanted to see how kids interact with these games, in order to inform the design of our web app.

                        Our team invited a total of 18 kids to Olin College to play with these circuit games. I wrote user testing scripts to gather useful insights from these sessions. I asked the same questions to each user, so that I could more easily see the differences between people's responses.

                            <p>Some kids thrive in structured learning environments, while others prefer to explore on their own.</p>

                        <p class="section-text">
                        Our team decided that Spark It should allow kids to build actual circuits using batteries, bulbs, resistors, and other components. Whenever the user uses a component for the first time, a popup will appear to provide educational information. For instance, if the user adds a resistor to their circuit, a contextual popup will appear and explain what a resistor does.

                        <p class="section-text">
                        I wrote all of the text for each popup, and in order to make these concepts more understandable for kids, I compared electricity to the flow of water in a river. This analogy is intuitive because water is much easier to visualize than electricity.

                        After building a prototype, our team tested it with another 12 kids. For this user test, I wrote a script to get both qualitative and quantitative feedback about our app. I was most interested in determining if there was actually some educational value to Spark It. So, I wrote a pre-test and a post-test that kids would take before and after playing through our app.
                        </p>

                            <p>For each test, we asked kids to tell us if the light bulb in each circuit would turn on or off. I based many of these questions around common misconceptions about circuits.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p class="section-text">
                        After playing the app, all 12 kids demonstrated improvement. They were able to learn new concepts about circuits that they never learned before. The test also revealed some of the problems with the wording in our app. For instance, some of the popups had too much information that didn't stick for many of the kids. One of the users skimmed the popup that explained the purpose of the battery, and when I asked her later about what a battery does, she responded, "The battery makes a connection to other stuff in the circuit." The vagueness of her answer implied that the popup needed to be simplified and re-worded.

                        After receiving all this useful feedback from user testing, I went through each of the popups and re-structured them to be more concise and understandable. I used more visual imagery and less text to convey each concept. Then, I documented all of my educational research before handing off Spark It to Dassault.

                        At the end of the year, our team presented the final version of our app to the Olin SCOPE community. Afterwards, many adults played through our app and said even they learned something new. I eagerly look forward to see this app become fully incorporated into the Apps for Kids suite in the near future!
