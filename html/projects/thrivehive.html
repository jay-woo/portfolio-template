                        <p class="section-text">
                        For our partner project at Startup Institute, our team worked with ThriveHive. a startup that provides digital marketing solutions for small business owners. ThriveHive asked us to build a web app that grades their users' contact lists. This app is meant to be a free service for users, who are looking to improve their small businesses. Using Hubspot's Website Grader as inspiration, this new tool would offer suggestions to help small business owners build better relationships with their customers. For example, the app could show small business owners which contacts are most likely to become paying customers.
                        </p>

                            <p>The idea for the contact list app came from Hubspot's Website Grader.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="section-text">
                        ThriveHive came to us with many exciting ideas about what this app should look like. However, before we committed to any specific ideas for this project, I performed user research to define the exact problem our team was trying to solve.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-text">
                        I met with designers and marketers from ThriveHive to gather as much information as possible about the users. I also performed user interviews with small business owners in the Boston area, so that I could put myself in their shoes. From these conversations, I learned that many small business owners are not super tech savvy, but know enough to use contact management tools like MailChimp and Google Contacts. They also do not use marketing jargon like "conversion rate" or "lead generation." The app should not use any of these terms, unless they come with clear definitions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-text">
                        Users are also reluctant to upload all of their contacts' information to a web application. They need assurance that all of their data is secure and confidential, before deciding to provide their contact list. The app must build trust, so that users are willing to let us analyze their data.

                        After collecting this preliminary information about our users, I sketched ideas in my notebook:
                        </p>

                        I collected feedback for my sketches, and decided on a specific direction for the first prototype. Users would have to login to our app via MailChimp, which is a popular contact list service amongst small business owners. This would allow them to upload their contact lists very easily. Our app would give these contact lists a score from 0-100, based on the completeness of their contacts' information. For instance, contacts who have not filled in their address, phone number, and other important fields will receive a low score. Our app would also generate a customized report to provide suggestions for the user should do next. I built an interactive prototype of this in Balsamiq:
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-text">
                        Finally, I used Sketch to produce high-fidelity mockups, which I sent to the development team. For these UI designs, I made sure to match ThriveHive's color scheme and typography.

                        <p class="section-text">
                        After the development team built a working prototype of my mockups, I user tested the app with small business owners. Many users liked the "High Scorer" section, and they liked the map visualization at the bottom of the "report card" screen. However, they were confused by the score at the top of the report. This number was not particularly useful for business owners who are looking for more actionable suggestions for growing their business. They also did not like the idea of being evaluated or judged by the app, due to the negative connotation that is often associated with a "grade." Based on these results, I pivoted the design to focus more on the map, instead of the numeric metrics. The name of the app also changed from "Contact Grader" to "Contact Mapper" to reflect these design changes.

                        If our team were able to spend more than 10 hours a week on this project, we would have liked to implement more features, such as Google Contacts integration. I would have liked to work on a third iteration, so that I could collect even more feedback for the app. However, given the time constraints, we stuck to a hard schedule that permitted us to run through two iterative cycles.
