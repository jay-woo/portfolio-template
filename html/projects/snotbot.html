                        As apex predators, whales accumulate toxins from all species that are lower in the food chain. If whales ingest high concentrations of toxic chemicals, the rest of the ocean is likely very toxic, as well. As a result, marine biologists have been interested in analyzing whale samples to get a sense for the overall health of the ocean. Marine biologists typically collect samples by firing crossbow bolts that are designed to tear out tissue samples, when shot directly at the whale's flesh. However, this traditional method of sample collection has a very high failure rate, and researchers are legally permitted to make only a certain number of collection attempts per year.

                        Our lab's solution, dubbed <i>Snotbot</i>, was to build a drone that would collect snot samples from whales. This would replace the more invasive and error-prone method of collecting skin samples. Whale snot provides a similar amount of biological information as whale flesh because it contains DNA, stress hormones, and environmental toxins. This would also allow researchers to collect an unlimited number of samples from whales, during a single expedition. To build a better understanding of the potential users, our team worked closely with Ocean Alliance, a nonprofit organization that has been studying the health of the world's oceans since 1971.

                        Before programming any drones, our team wanted to gather more information about our users: the marine biologists. Two of my labmates and I traveled to the Gulf of Mexico on a research vessel with a crew from Ocean Alliance, in order to observe how they conducted field research and to understand the system constraints.

                        For a week, I helped Ocean Alliance researchers collect whale samples with the biopsy crossbow. I lived and worked alongside the crewmembers to truly be in their shoes. From this hands-on experience, I learned  a tremendous deal about our users' wants and needs. This journey map tracks the emotional roller-coaster that a crew member goes through when making a successful collection attempt:

                        Many of the crew's frustrations were due to the high number of failure cases. In several instances, the arrow failed to pierce the whale's flesh. One time, we even lost sight the arrow, and the sample was lost to the ocean's currents. Whenever these errors occur, the crew's morale takes a hit and it is easy to pin the blame on a single individual. I definitely felt the performance anxiety when I was on net duty because if I didn't scoop up the arrow in time, the team could lose a valuable sample.

                        From these observations, I fleshed out the system architecture of Snotbot. This diagram illustrates the proposed design:

                        <p class="section-text">
                        By moving many of the tasks to the autonomous robot, this system is far less susceptible to human error. However, one of the main drawbacks of this system is that the drone must be extremely reliable. For instance, if the drone malfunctions and is not able to return to the boat, the crew would lose both the sample and the expensive drone. This would be far more frustrating than losing a single flesh sample. To prevent these system errors, I made sure to add failsafe procedures to make sure that the drone can be easily recovered.

                        When I joined the Snotbot project, I had very little programming experience, let alone drone programming experience. The rest of my labmates were in a similar position, so I had to learn to write robotics software from square one. Over the first couple months, I learned to use Python, Git, and the Robotic Operating System (ROS). Once I got a handle of the basics, I designed a software architecture, which was heavily influenced by my user research:
                        </p>

                        <div class="captioned-image center-align">

                            <p>The drone is controlled by an XBOX controller. The circles represent different buttons on the controller, and the rectangles represent the drone's different states.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p class="section-text">
                        I wrote the code for this software architecture, with the exception of the Track procedure. One of the most challenging pieces of this was the Land procedure. In order for the drone to land at a very particular part of the ship, I attached an augmented reality marker to the landing platform. Using a downward facing camera, the drone can calculate its horizontal position relative to the marker and adjust its position so that the marker is directly below the landing drone.
                        </p>

                        After doing a lot of the implementation, I wrote educational documentation, so that newcomers to the lab can quickly get started programming drones. I compiled a lot of the obscure information I learned along the way and wrote step-by-step tutorials for each piece of my software. I made sure that people understood my documentation by getting feedback from lab members who had never touched drones before. As a result, my labmates were able to replicate my work and develop a stronger understanding of the Snotbot system as a whole. Here are some examples of my documentation:

                        We still need to implement several major features, such as using computer vision to locate and track whales. We also need to test our MVP with marine biologists, but due to the high cost of whale research expeditions, this was infeasible in our given time frame. Despite these roadblocks, we were able to make significant progress towards Snotbot's very ambitious goal of autonomous snot collection!
