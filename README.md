## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Materialize

Responsive design to make sure my website is usable across a wide range of viewports (mobile to desktop)

Used Materialize for navigation features like the sidebar and the scroll tracker
Some of the navigation features disappear for smaller viewports

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where to share those moments! Recruiters love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
